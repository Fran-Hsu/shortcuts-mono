## sc-remote-installer

A shortcut that you can get random meme by one clicking, I always put it on my homescreen!

### Usage

Currently, this shortcut could not be implement using `shortcut-js`, to note the logic of this shortcu I put the reversed JSON of the `get-meme` temporary until `shortcut-js` support [`repeat with`](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js/pull/371) and [`filter file`](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js/pull/372).

The above links are my feature implementation PRs, if someone could do me a favor review that, it would be awesome!
